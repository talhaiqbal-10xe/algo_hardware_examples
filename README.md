# algo_hardware_examples

This repo contains a vivado 2022.1 project.
The project contains simple examples about optimizing an expression for an algothrim to make it hardware friendly.
The user can clone the repo and synthesize the two varients of a single expression and see the differences for himself.
There are two (arithematic_operation, and blc) files each containing two modules representing two approaches for the same operation (arithematic_operation1 and arithematic_operation1)
To synthesize, you should set a particular module as top module and then run systhesis
The soruce files can be found in a separate directory too for sythesis with any other tool
